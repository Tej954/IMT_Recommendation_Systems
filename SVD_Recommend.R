#Now lets compare the imputed matrix with the reconstructed matrix and understand the implications

#Role of Dimensionality Reduction: Typically, the power of SVD in applications 
#like recommendation systems or data compression comes from dimensionality 
#reduction â€” retaining only the top-k singular values and vectors, which captures the 
#most significant underlying patterns while discarding noise or less relevant details. 
#Without this reduction, the reconstruction is just a mathematical reformation of the 
#original (imputed) data. 


# Approximate the matrix using a reduced rank (e.g., 3)
k <- 3  # Choose a suitable rank based on data analysis
